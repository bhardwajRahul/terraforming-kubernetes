# Terraforming Kubernetes
What if starting a remote virtual machine instance was as simple as changing a number on a document and running a command? That is how simple terraform can be and why it's so powerful.

Using documents to change what server we need running is a feature of Infrastructure as Code and can be a paradigm shift for many developers since it's so simple yet effective. One of the biggest advantages of IaC and terraform: version control and CI/CD pipeline automation.

Terraform will turn on (and off) the servers we need. Kubernetes will manage how we allocate the resources on those servers to run the applications we want and need. The pair is a juggernaut of automation. This post will teach you exactly what to do to use them both.
